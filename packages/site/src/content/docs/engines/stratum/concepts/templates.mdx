_Templates_ are generated in the Stratum engine by grouping together [Presets](/engines/stratum/concepts/presets).

Templates are the highest layer in Stratum.
Stratum-generated Templates can be used as general Bingo templates: under the hood, they are created with the same [`createTemplate` API](/build/apis/create-template) as any other template.

For example, this Template groups several levels of tooling from a `create-typescript-app`-like generator:

```ts
import { createTemplate } from "bingo";

import { presetCommon } from "./presetCommon";
import { presetEverything } from "./presetEverything";
import { presetMinimal } from "./presetMinimal";

export const template = createTemplate({
	about: {
		name: "Stratum Example",
	},
	presets: [
		{ label: "Minimal", preset: presetMinimal },
		{ label: "Common", preset: presetCommon },
		{ label: "Everything", preset: presetEverything },
	],
	suggested: presetCommon,
});
```

The preset labels are turned into a `--preset` option.
Runners like [Template CLIs](/cli) will know to prompt for a preset if not provided:

```plaintext
$ npx create-typescript-app

┌  ✨ create-typescript-app@2.0.0 ✨
│
│  Learn more on: https://github.com/JoshuaKGoldberg/create-typescript-app
│
│  Running with mode --initialize for a new repository.
│
│  What will the --preset be?
```

## Options

Stratum Templates source their `options` from their [Base](/engines/stratum/concepts/bases).
Options declared on a Template's Base are what may be set in a configuration's `options`.

### `--preset`

All Stratum Templates include a `--preset`, option which is a required string.
It is a union of the lowercased labels provided under `presets`.

For example, given the earlier `template` with three Presets, the `--preset` option would be type `"common" | "everything" | "minimal"`:

It could be specified on the CLI:

```shell
npx create-stratum-example --preset everything
```

Presets can also be specified as a standard option in a configuration file:

```ts title="create-stratum-example.config.ts"
import { template } from "create-stratum-example";

export default createConfig(template, {
	options: {
		preset: "everything",
	},
});
```

During transition mode, Stratum will attempt to infer a default value for `--preset` based using files on disk.
That default value is computed by comparing existing files on disk to the files that would be produced by the Blocks.
If Preset with the greatest percentage matches 35% or more of its created files, it will be used as the default.

### Exclusion Options

Stratum Templates also add `--exclude-*` CLI options for each of their named Blocks.
Each Block name is transformed to kebab-cases boolean option that defaults to `false`.

For example, given the following named `ESLint` Block:

```ts
import { base } from "./base";

export const blockESLint = base.createBlock({
	about: {
		name: "ESLint",
	},
	produce() {
		return {
			files: {
				"eslint.config.js": "...",
			},
		};
	},
});
```

If a Stratum Template includes that Block, it will have an `--exclude-eslint` option available on the CLI:

```shell
npx create-stratum-example --exclude-eslint
```

:::note
Exclusion options are not added to the TypeScript types of `createConfig` functions in configuration files.
See [Details > Configurations > Refinements > `exclude`](/engines/stratum/details/configurations#exclude) for excluding Blocks in configuration files.
