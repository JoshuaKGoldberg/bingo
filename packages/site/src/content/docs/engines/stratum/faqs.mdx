## Where does the name _"Stratum"_ come from?

_"Stratum"_ refers to a layer or level in a structured system, such as geological strata or organizational layers.
That's thematically tied to how the engine works:

- [Bases](/engines/stratum/concepts/bases) form the underlying base layer upon which other layers are built
- [Blocks](/engines/stratum/concepts/blocks) make available individual pieces of structure
- [Presets](/engines/stratum/concepts/presets) group together structures into usable layers of tooling

It also looks and sounds sophisticated.
_"Stratum"_.
