description: How Stratum Presets generate productions from their Blocks.
title: Stratum Execution
---

Stratum [Templates](/engines/stratum/concepts/templates) don't have their own explicit `produce()` function.
They instead automatically produce all the [Blocks](/engines/stratum/concepts/blocks) defined by their Preset.

Stratum continuosly re-runs Blocks until no new Addons are provided.
The algorithm is roughly...

1. Collect all Blocks defined in the Preset, along with their Addons:
   1. Run any [`intake`](/engines/stratum/apis/create-base#createblock-intake) methods to generate default Addons value
   2. Apply all [`refinements`](/engines/stratum/details/configurations/#refinements) on top of those
2. Create a queue of Blocks to be run, starting with all defined in the Preset
3. For each Block in the queue:
   1. Get the Creation from the Block, passing any current known Addons
   2. If a [Mode](/build/concepts/modes) is specified, additionally generate the approprate Block Creations
   3. Store that Block's Creation
   4. If the Block specified new addons for any defined Blocks:
      1. Add those Blocks to the queue of Blocks to re-run
4. Merge all Block Creations together
