import { PackageManagers } from "starlight-package-managers";

[Handlebars](https://handlebarsjs.com) is a popular templating language.
It allows defining plain text templates with indications for where to substitue in dynamic values.

The [`bingo-handlebars`](https://npmjs.com/package/bingo-handlebars) package provides wrapping logic to use Handlebars templates to generate file creations.

<PackageManagers type="add" pkg="bingo-handlebars" />

If you'd like to use the Handlebars langauge in your Bingo template, you have two options:

1. [`handlebars()`](/engines/handlebars/handlebars): applies Handlebars templates from a single path.
2. [`loadHandlebars()`](/engines/handlebars/handlebars): generates a reusable `handlebars()`

See the [Handlebars Language Guide](https://handlebarsjs.com/guide) for details on the Handlebars templating language.
