Descriptions of network requests as used by Bingo. üì†

<PackageManagers type="add" pkg="bingo-requests" dev />

The separate `bingo-requests` package includes types for the serialized request objects used in [Concepts > Creations > `requests`](/build/concepts/creations#requests).

These requests are type-safe when possible, most notably with GitHub Octokit endpoints.

## Requests

All request objects may contain the following properties:

- `id` _(optional)_: Unique ID for logging and to differentiate between requests to the same endpoint
  - See [Merging > `requests`](/build/details/merging#requests) for how requests are merged
- `silent` _(optional)_: Whether to skip logging errors if the request fails
- `type` _(required)_: Which type of request this is, as either:
  - `"fetch"`: A [`CreatedFetchRequest`](#createdfetchrequest)
  - `"octokit"`: A [`CreatedOctokitRequest`](#createdoctokitrequest)

### `CreatedFetchRequest`

Description of a request to send with [`fetch()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API).

These additionally contain:

- `init` _(optional)_: Any [`RequestInit`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/RequestInit) options to be sent as the second parameter to `fetch()`
- `url` _(required)_: URL to send the request to

For example, this object describes a `GET` request to `https://create.bingo`:

```ts
import { CreatedFetchRequest } from "bingo-requests";

export const request: CreatedFetchRequest = {
	type: "fetch",
	url: "https://create.bingo",
};
```

The `id` field can be useful to disambiguate two requests to the same URL.
Bingo by default merges fetch requests that have the same `url` data into one request.
If you need to send two requests to the same URL, you can give them different `id` values.

For example, these two objects describe separate `POST` requests to `https://create.bingo`:

```ts
import { CreatedFetchRequest } from "bingo-requests";

export const requests: CreatedFetchRequest[] = [
	{
		id: "first",
		init: {
			body: "(first)",
			method: "POST",
		},
		type: "fetch",
		url: "https://create.bingo",
	},
	{
		id: "second",
		init: {
			body: "(second)",
			method: "POST",
		},
		type: "fetch",
		url: "https://create.bingo",
	},
];
```

:::tip
Fetch requests are generally not type-safe.
If you would like `bingo-requests` to allow type-safe requests to a type of endpoint other than Octokit, please [file a feature request on GitHub](https://github.com/JoshuaKGoldberg/bingo/issues/new?template=03-feature.yml).

### `CreatedOctokitRequest`

Description of a request to send with [Octokit](https://octokit.github.io/rest.js).

These additionally contain:

- `endpoint`: Octokit endpoint to send to
- `parameters`: Parameter data to attach to the request

For example, this object describes a request to add a label to a repository:

```ts
import { CreatedOctokitRequest } from "bingo-requests";

export const request: CreatedOctokitRequest = {
	endpoint: "POST /repos/{owner}/{repo}/labels",
	parameters: {
		name: "good first issue",
		owner: "JoshuaKGoldberg",
		repo: "create-typescript-app",
	},
	type: "octokit",
};
```

The `id` field can be useful to disambiguate two requests to the same endpoint.
Bingo by default merges Octokit requests that have the same `url` data into one request.
If you need to send two requests to the same endpoint, you can give them different `id` values.

For example, these two objects describe separate requests to add labels to a repository:

```ts
import { CreatedFetchRequest } from "bingo-requests";

export const requests: CreatedFetchRequest[] = [
	{
		endpoint: "POST /repos/{owner}/{repo}/labels",
		id: "first",
		parameters: {
			name: "good first issue",
			owner: "JoshuaKGoldberg",
			repo: "create-typescript-app",
		},
		type: "octokit",
	},
	{
		endpoint: "POST /repos/{owner}/{repo}/labels",
		id: "second",
		parameters: {
			name: "wontfix",
			owner: "JoshuaKGoldberg",
			repo: "create-typescript-app",
		},
		type: "octokit",
	},
];
```

Octokit requests are generally type-safe, in that their types are generated from [`@octokit/types`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@octokit/types):

- `endpoint` is typed as the keys of [`Endpoints`](https://octokit.github.io/types.ts/interfaces/Endpoints.html)
- `parameters` is typed as the parameters for the endpoint `&` [`RequestParameters`](https://octokit.github.io/types.ts/types/RequestParameters.html)

If you would like `bingo-requests` to allow type-safe requests to a type of endpoint other than Octokit, such as a different common repository host, please [file a feature request on GitHub](https://github.com/JoshuaKGoldberg/bingo/issues/new?template=03-feature.yml).
