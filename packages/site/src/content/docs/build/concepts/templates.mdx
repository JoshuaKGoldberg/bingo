A _Template_ is a description of how to setup or transition a repository given a set of options.

Each `create` template defines:

1. The options it takes in, defined as Zod schemas
2. A "producer" function that takes in those options and outputs a description of a repository

:::tip
`create` templates are conventionally stored in packages whose names start with `create-`.
See [JoshuaKGoldberg/create-example](https://github.com/JoshuaKGoldberg/create-example) for an example starter repository template.

## Defining Templates

`create` templates are defined with the [`createTemplate`](/build/apis/create-template) function exported by the `create` npm package.
It takes in an object with properties for those options and producer function.
It returns a [`Creation`](/build/concepts/creations) object.

The following example template takes in a `repository` option and produces a `README.md` file with a heading:

```ts title="example-template.js"
import { createTemplate } from "create";
import { z } from "zod";

export default createTemplate({
	options: {
		title: z.string(),
	},
	produce({ options }) {
		return {
			files: {
				"README.md": `# ${options.title}`,
			},
		};
	},
});
```

If someone were to run `npx create ./example-template.js`, it would know to ask for a `title`:

```plaintext title="npx create ./example-template.js"
┌  ✨ create ✨
│
│  Welcome to create: a delightful repository templating engine.
│
│  Learn more about create on:
│    https://create.bingo
│
│  Running with mode --setup for a new repository using the template:
│    ./example-template.js
|
| What will the title be? (--title)
```

If someone were to run `npx create ./example-template.js --title "Hello World"`, a `README.md` file would be created with that title as a heading:

```md title="README.md"
# Hello World
```

## Template Systems

A single `produce()` function generally doesn't scale well beyond small straightforward repositories.
Templates generally end up using one or more template systems for defining files.

1. [Handlebars]: allows defining files as [handlebars](https://handlebarsjs.com) templates.
   Generally recommended for straightforward templates that have more than a dozen files.
2. [Blocks]: a rich system to define each feature of a template as an independent "blocks".
   Recommended for templates that want to allow rich logic and/or multiple starting presets.
