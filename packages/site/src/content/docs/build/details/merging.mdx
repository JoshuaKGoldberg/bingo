description: "How the engine merges creations from multiple producer functions."
title: Merging
---

Template producer functions return [Creation](/build/concepts/creations) objects.
When a `--mode` is specified, a template may run multiple producer functions.
The two creations from those producer functions will need to be merged together.

Each type of creation has its own merging logic:

- [`files`](#files)
- [`requests`](#requests)
- [`scripts`](#scripts)
- [`suggestions`](#suggestions)

## Files

[File](/build/concepts/creations#files) objects are recursively merged:

- `false` and `undefined` values are ignored
- Files are deduplicated if they have the same value, and an error is thrown if they do not

For example, given the following two `files` Creations to be merged:

```ts
{
   "LICENSE.txt": "# MIT",
   src: {
      "index.ts": `export * from "./types.ts"`,
   },
}
```

```ts
{
   "LICENSE.txt": "# MIT",
   src: {
      "types.ts": `export type Example = true;`,
   },
}
```

The merged result would be:

```ts
{
   "LICENSE.txt": "# MIT",
   src: {
      "index.ts": `export * from "./types.ts"`,
      "types.ts": `export type Example = true;`,
   },
}
```

## Requests

[Requests](/build/concepts/creations#requests) are merged base on their `id` and `type`:
_ If two requests have different `id` values, they are always considered separate
_ Otherwise, requests are merged based on their `type`:
_ `fetch` requests have `init` merged with `Object.assign()` if they contain the same `url`
_ `octokit` requests have `parameters` merged with `Object.assign()` if they contain the same `endpoint`

For example, the following two `requests` Creations would not be merged, because they have different endpoints:

```ts
[
	{
		endpoint: "POST /repos/{owner}/{repo}/autolinks",
		parameters: {
			key_prefix: "TICKET-",
			owner: "JoshuaKGoldberg",
			repo: "create-typescript-app",
			url_template: "https://example.com/TICKET?query=<num>",
		}
		type: "octokit",
	},
	{
		endpoint: "POST /repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues",
		parameters: {
			name: "good first issue",
			owner: "JoshuaKGoldberg",
			repo: "create-typescript-app",
		}
		type: "octokit",
	}
]
```

However, the following two `requests` Creations would be merged into one with the same endpoint:

```ts
[
	{
		endpoint: "POST /repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues",
		parameters: {
			color: "#ffcc00",
			name: "good first issue (pending color)",
			owner: "JoshuaKGoldberg",
			repo: "create-typescript-app",
		}
		type: "octokit",
	},
	{
		endpoint: "POST /repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues",
		parameters: {
			name: "good first issue",
			owner: "JoshuaKGoldberg",
			repo: "create-typescript-app",
		}
		type: "octokit",
	}
]
```

The merged result would be:

```ts
[
	{
		endpoint: "POST /repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues",
		parameters: {
			color: "#ffcc00",
			name: "good first issue",
			owner: "JoshuaKGoldberg",
			repo: "create-typescript-app",
		}
		type: "octokit",
	}
]
```

## Scripts

[Scripts](/build/concepts/creations#scripts) are deduplicated based on whether they include a `phase`:

- "Phase" scripts are deduplicated if any's arrays of `commands` are the same as any other
- "Standalone" scripts provided as `string` are deduplicated and run in parallel after scripts with phases

For example, given the following two `scripts` Creations to be merged:

```ts
[
	{
		commands: ["pnpm install", "pnpm dedupe"],
		phase: 0,
	},
];
```

```ts
[
	`npx set-github-repository-labels --labels "$(cat labels.json)"`,
	{
		commands: ["pnpm install"],
		phase: 0,
	},
];
```

The merged result would be:

```ts
[
	{
		commands: ["pnpm install", "pnpm dedupe"],
		phase: 0,
	},
	`npx set-github-repository-labels --labels "$(cat labels.json)"`,
];
```

## Suggestions

[Suggestions](/build/concepts/creations#suggestions) are deduplicated by identity.

For example, given the following two `suggestions` Creations to be merged:

```ts
[
	"- set a CODECOV secret to an codecov repository token",
	"- set a NPM_TOKEN secret to an npm automation token",
];
```

```ts
[
	"- set an ACCESS_TOKEN secret to a GitHub PAT with repo and workflow permissions",
	"- set a NPM_TOKEN secret to an npm access token with automation permissions",
];
```

The merged result would be:

```ts
[
	"- set a CODECOV secret to an codecov repository token",
	"- set a NPM_TOKEN secret to an npm access token with automation permissions",
	"- set an ACCESS_TOKEN secret to a GitHub PAT with repo and workflow permissions",
];
```
