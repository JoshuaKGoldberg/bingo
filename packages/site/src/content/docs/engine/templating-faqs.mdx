`create` is _very_ early stage.
It is just barely past proof-of-concept stage.

Right now, it's being developed as an MVP to generalize the internals of [create-typescript-app](https://github.com/JoshuaKGoldberg/create-typescript-app).
Soon it will be more stable and these docs will be updated.

## Bases

### Why do Bases use a `produce()` for Options, not Zod methods like `refine` or `transform`?

`create` intentionally does not use any Zod features beyond creating and describing schemas.
This is for two reasons:

- Bases often need data to be shared between multiple -even many- different Options.
  Loading implementations become much cleaner when all data loaders can be declared once in a `produce()` function,
  wrapped in a caching [`lazyValue`](https://github.com/sindresorhus/lazy-value), then used as needed across any number of Options.
- Long-term, the engine should not be locked into any one schema engine.
  Adopting Zod-specific features will make it harder to swap between other implementers of [standard-schema](https://github.com/standard-schema/standard-schema) in the future if needed.

See the [`create-typescript-app` Base `produce()` implementation](https://github.com/JoshuaKGoldberg/create-typescript-app/blob/c6714eeb02a5106eb5e4e4694f1e8b590444030d/src/base.ts#L138) for an example of values used across Options.

## Blocks

### This Blocks system is a lot of work. Is there a more straightforward system?

Not yet, but there will be.
Less-heavyweight engines will soon be available to make authoring straightforward Templates easier.
See [create#76 ðŸš€ Feature: Switch to a pluggable templating engine system](https://github.com/JoshuaKGoldberg/create/issues/76).

### Why can't we define Addons for Blocks in Presets?

In other words, you might be wondering why the API doesn't allow something like this:

```js
export const presetExample = base.createPreset({
	blocks: [
		myBlock({
			someArg: "...",
		}),
	],
});
```

This is because Blocks shouldn't need to be configured.
Users should be able to turn them off and on at will without any configuration.

Passing Addons to a Block in a Preset means users will have no way to override or remove those Addons.

## Testing

### Why do some testers allow `take` and others the individual system pieces?

It depends on what APIs the entities under test conceptually use.

| Entity                               | Mock    | Why                                                                                           |
| ------------------------------------ | ------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [Bases](./engine/concepts/bases)     | `take`  | Bases should go through Inputs to interact with the system.                                   |
| [Blocks](./engine/concepts/blocks)   | Neither | Blocks should be synchronous and take any input values from their Base Options.               |
| [Inputs](./engine/runtime/inputs)    | Both    | Inputs receive system pieces, and can also `take` other Inputs.                               |
| [Presets](./engine/concepts/presets) | System  | High-level users of Presets should not care about low-level implementation details of Inputs. |
