title: Presets

A _Preset_ defines a group of [Blocks](./blocks) that can be put together to form a repository base.
Each Preset includes of a `blocks` array consisting of Blocks generated by the same parent [Base](./bases).

For example, this Preset combines two of the blocks from [Blocks](./blocks):

```ts
import { base } from "./base";
import { blockNvmrc } from "./blockNvmrc";
import { blockREADME } from "./blockREADME";

export const presetExampleBlocks = base.createPreset({
	about: {
		name: "Example",
	},
	blocks: [blockNvmrc, blockREADME],
});
```
