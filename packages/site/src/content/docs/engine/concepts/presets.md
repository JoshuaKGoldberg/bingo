:::danger
The `create` engine is very early stage.
Don't rely on it yet.
:::

A _Preset_ defines a group of [Blocks](./blocks) that can be put together to form a repository base.
Each Preset includes of a `blocks` array consisting of Blocks generated by the same parent [Schema](./schemas).

For example, this Preset combines two of the blocks from [Blocks](./blocks):

```ts
import { blockNvmrc } from "./blockNvmrc";
import { blockREADME } from "./blockREADME";
import { schema } from "./schemas";

export const presetExampleBlocks = schema.createPreset({
	blocks: [blockNvmrc(), blockREADME()],
});
```

## APIs

- [`createPreset`](../apis/creators#createpreset): for creating Presets
- [`producePreset`](../apis/producers#producepreset): for producing a Preset's Blocks
- [`testPreset`](../apis/testers#testpreset): for simulating Preset production
