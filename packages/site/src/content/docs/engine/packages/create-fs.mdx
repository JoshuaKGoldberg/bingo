<PackageManagers type="add" pkg="create-fs" />

The separate `create-fs` package includes types and utility functions for the file system used in [Runtime > Creations > `files`](https://www.create.bingo/engine/runtime/creations#files).

This file system is a simplified abstraction over the lower-level APIs in Node.js and other platforms.
APIs and data are optimized for simplicity and ease of use, rather than completeness.

For example, given a structure like:

```plaintext
/
└── README.md
└── src
    └── index.ts
```

`create-fs` would represent that structure with an object like:

```json
{
	"README.md": "...",
	"src": {
		"index.ts": "..."
	}
}
```
