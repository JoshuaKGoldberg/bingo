title: Runner APIs
---

Runner APIs can be used to execute and apply [Creations](../runtime/creations) on disk:

- [`runBlock`](#runblock): applies a [Block](../concepts/blocks) production
- [`runTemplate`](#runtemplate): applies a [Template](../concepts/templates) production

Each runner API takes in up to two arguments:

1. The construct to be run
2. An object with properties from the construct's context as well as:
   - `directory: string` (default: `'.'`): The root directory to write files to
   - `mode` (optional): What [runtime mode](../runtime/execution#modes) to run in
   - `options` (optional): The construct's Options values
   - Any properties from [System contexts](../runtime/contexts#system-contexts) (optional)

:::note
Runner APIs apply their generated objects to disk, as well as executing any network requests and shell commands.
For APIs that only create those objects in memory, see [Producers](./producers).
:::

## `runBlock`

Given a [Block](../concepts/blocks), executes a [Creation](../runtime/creations) output by running its [`produce()`](../concepts/blocks#production).

See [Producers > `runBlock`](./producers#runblock) for the arguments `runBlock` allows.

For example, given a Block that creates a `README.md`, this would write that file to system:

```ts
import { runBlock } from "create";
import { blockReadme } from "./blockReadme.js";

await runBlock(blockReadme);
```

## `runTemplate`

Given a [Template](../concepts/templates) and the name of one of its [Presets](../concepts/presets), executes a [Creation](../runtime/creations) output by running each of the Preset's Blocks' [`produce()`](../concepts/blocks#production).

See [Producers > `produceBlock`](./producers#produceblock) for the arguments `runTemplate` allows.

For example, given a Template and Preset containing the previous Block that creates a `README.md`, this would write that file to system:

```ts
import { runBlock } from "create";
import { template } from "./template.js";

await runTemplate(presetWithReadme, {
	options: {
		// ...
	},
	preset: "my-preset",
});
```
