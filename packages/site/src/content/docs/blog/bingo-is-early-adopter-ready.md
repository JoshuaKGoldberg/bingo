Hello, world! 💝

I'm happy to announce that Bingo is _"early adopter ready"_.
If you maintain any kind of repository template, Bingo is ready for you to try out.

What's Bingo, you ask?
What does early adoption mean?
Great questions!

## Bingo?

Bingo is a tool for delightful web repository templates.
It provides rich scaffolding for building flexible repository templates that describe the files and settings for projects.

You can think of Bingo as a framework for repository templates.
Instead of giving it a description of a UI (a la React) or an HTTP server (a la Express), Bingo takes in a description of how to create the files to scaffold a repository.

:::tip
The closest equivalents to Bingo are [Plop](https://plopjs.com) and [Yeoman](https://yeoman.io).
See [FAQs > Ecosystem Comparisons](https://www.create.bingo/faqs/#ecosystem-comparisons) to learn how Bingo compares with other tools.

## Early Adopter Ready?

Bingo has been running in the beta 2.x version of [create-typescript-app](https://github.com/JoshuaKGoldberg/create-typescript-app) ("CTA") for several months.
CTA's 2.x graduated from beta to stable last week.
It was able to do so because Bingo is relatively stable at runtime: it does not crash in common usage scenarios and its APIs are documented.

However, Bingo is still early stage and pre-1.x.
It hasn't been used by any other projects beyond CTA.
There will likely be many bugs, documentation issues, and important features to be resolved before Bingo stabilizes.

Bingo is ready for you to try out building a repository template - if you don't mind being an "early adopter".
Some APIs will likely change over the next year as early adopters put Bingo through its paces.

Please do try Bingo out and give feedback!
