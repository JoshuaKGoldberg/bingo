`create` is an engine for building repositories from templates.
It provides tooling for:

- **Initialization**: Creating new repositories from templates with a single CLI command
- **Migration**: Updating existing repositories to the newest versions of their template

See **[CLI](./cli)** to generate your first repository from a template with the `create` command:

<PackageManagers type="dlx" pkg="create" args="typescript-app@beta" />

`create` also provides rich scaffolding for building flexible repository templates that describe the files and settings for projects, as well as configurable, type-safe options for customizations.

## Why?

Keeping up to date with the latest and greatest in web development tooling is _hard_:

1. Configuring all sorts of useful tools from scratch takes a lot of time and effort.
2. As tools change, rolling out improvements to all your repositories is even more time and effort.

`create` helps with both of those problems.

It allows you to pull in great tooling from templates such as [`create-typescript-app`](https://github.com/JoshuaKGoldberg/create-typescript-app) -- without needing to configure it all from scratch.
Templates can define both the raw files on disk as well as GitHub repository settings.

`create` additionally includes great support for updating your repositories as templates change.
Existing template options are inferred from your existing repository.
Rich persistent customizations can be defined in a configuration file.

Put together, `create` is a comprehensive solution for keeping repositories on the latest and greatest in web development tooling.

## Status

`create` is _very_ early stage.
