Bingo is a tool for delightful web repository templates.
Pass the name of a template to the `bingo` CLI command, and it'll make a new repository for you.

<PackageManagers type="dlx" pkg="bingo" args="typescript-app@beta" />

With Bingo templates, you can have fully-formed, wonderful dev tooling in your repositories -- without setting all those tools up from scratch yourself.

> üöÄ See **[CLI](/cli)** to generate your first repository from a template with the Bingo command.

## What?

Bingo provides tooling for:

- **Setup**: Creating new repositories from templates with a single CLI command
- **Transition**: Updating existing repositories to the newest versions of their template

The Bingo project also provides rich scaffolding for building flexible repository templates that describe the files and settings for projects.

> ‚öôÔ∏è See **[Templating Engine](/build/about)** to learn how to write your own templates.

## Why?

Keeping up to date with the latest and greatest in web development tooling can be taxing:

1. Configuring all sorts of useful tools from scratch takes a lot of time and effort.
2. As tools change, rolling out improvements to all your repositories is even more time and effort.

Bingo helps with both of those problems.

It allows you to pull in great tooling from templates such as [`create-typescript-app`](https://github.com/JoshuaKGoldberg/create-typescript-app) without needing to configure it all from scratch.
Templates can define both the raw files on disk as well as GitHub repository settings and commands to run that initialize repositories.

Bingo additionally includes great support for updating your repositories as templates change.
Existing template options are inferred from your existing repository.
Rich persistent customizations can be defined in a configuration file.

Put together, Bingo is a comprehensive solution for keeping repositories on the latest and greatest in web development tooling.
