import { PackageManagers } from "starlight-package-managers";

`create` makes it straightforward to create new repositories from templates.
Pass the name of a template to the `create` CLI command, and it'll make a new repository for you.

<PackageManagers type="dlx" pkg="create" args="typescript-app@beta" />

With `create` templates, you can have fully-formed, wonderful dev tooling in your repositories -- without setting all those tools up from scratch yourself.

> See **[CLI](/cli)** to generate your first repository from a template with the `create` command:

## What?

`create` provides tooling for:

- **Setup**: Creating new repositories from templates with a single CLI command
- **Transition**: Updating existing repositories to the newest versions of their template

The `create` project also provides rich scaffolding for building flexible repository templates that describe the files and settings for projects.

> See **[Templating Engine](/build/about)** to learn how to write your own templates.

## Why?

Keeping up to date with the latest and greatest in web development tooling is _hard_:

1. Configuring all sorts of useful tools from scratch takes a lot of time and effort.
2. As tools change, rolling out improvements to all your repositories is even more time and effort.

`create` helps with both of those problems.

It allows you to pull in great tooling from templates such as [`create-typescript-app`](https://github.com/JoshuaKGoldberg/create-typescript-app) -- without needing to configure it all from scratch.
Templates can define both the raw files on disk as well as GitHub repository settings and commands to run that initialize templates.

`create` additionally includes great support for updating your repositories as templates change.
Existing template options are inferred from your existing repository.
Rich persistent customizations can be defined in a configuration file.

Put together, `create` is a comprehensive solution for keeping repositories on the latest and greatest in web development tooling.
