Bingo is a framework for delightful web repository templates.
Templates built with Bingo provide friendly CLIs that walk you through making a new repository:

<PackageManagers type="dlx" pkg="create-typescript-app" />

With Bingo templates, you can have fully-formed, wonderful dev tooling in your repositories -- without setting all those tools up from scratch yourself.

> üöÄ See **[CLI](/cli)** for more details on generating repositories from Bingo templates.

## What?

The Bingo project provides rich scaffolding for building flexible repository templates that describe the files and settings for projects.

Tooling is oriented around two execution modes:

- **Setup**: Creating new repositories from templates with a single CLI command
- **Transition**: Updating existing repositories to the newest versions of their template

> ‚öôÔ∏è See **[Building Templates](/build/about)** to learn how to write your own templates.

## Why?

Keeping up to date with the latest and greatest in web development tooling can be taxing:

1. Configuring all sorts of useful tools from scratch takes a lot of time and effort.
2. As tools change, rolling out improvements to all your repositories is even more time and effort.

Bingo helps with both of those problems.

Bingo enables templates like [`create-typescript-app`](https://github.com/JoshuaKGoldberg/create-typescript-app) to give you great tooling without needing to configure it all from scratch yourself.
Templates can define files, initialization commands, and even GitHub repository settings to set via the API.

Bingo additionally includes great support for updating your repositories as templates change.
Default options are inferred from your existing repository and/or an optional configuration file.

Put together, Bingo is a comprehensive solution for keeping repositories on the latest and greatest in web development tooling.
