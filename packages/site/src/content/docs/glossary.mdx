## Args

Individual arguments passed to a [Block](./engine/concepts/blocks) or [Input](./runtime/inputs).
These are completely separate from [Options](#options).

## Base

> ðŸ‘‰ See: [Concepts > Bases](./engine/concepts/bases).

A listing of option types and how to generate their default values.

Bases are used to create child [Blocks](#block) and [Presets](#preset).

## Base Context

> ðŸ‘‰ See: [Runtime > Contexts > Base Contexts](./runtime/contexts#base-contexts).

The shared helper functions and information provided to [Bases](#base).

These include user-provided [Options](#options), if they exist.

## Base Definition

A description of a [Base](#base).

Bases are created by providing a Base Definition to the [`createBase`](./apis/creators#createbase) function provided by `create`.

## Block

> ðŸ‘‰ See: [Concepts > Blocks](./engine/concepts/blocks).

A Block defines the logic to create a portion of a repository.

Each Block is associated with a parent [Base](#base), which defines the [Options](#options) the Block may access during production.

## Block Definition

A description of a [Block](#block).

[Bases](#base) create Blocks with a [`createBlock()`](./apis/creators#createblock) method, which takes in a Block Definition and returns a Block.

## Block Context

> ðŸ‘‰ See: [Runtime > Contexts > Block Contexts](./runtime/contexts#block-contexts).

The shared helper functions and information provided to [Blocks](#block).

These include [Options](#options) as defined by the parent [Base](#base) as well as any [Args](#args) defined by the Block.

## Context

> ðŸ‘‰ See: [Runtime > Contexts](./runtime/contexts).

Helper functions and information provided to [Blocks](#block), [Inputs](#input), and [Bases](#base).

## Creation

> ðŸ‘‰ See: [Runtime > Creations](./runtime/creations).

The produced outputs generated by [Blocks](#block) and [Presets](#preset).

Creations describe the contents of a repository, such as files on disk or initialization shell commands.

## Input

> ðŸ‘‰ See: [Concepts > Inputs](./runtime/inputs).

A standalone function that can be used to provide dynamic data by [Blocks](#block) and [Bases](#base).

## Input Context

> ðŸ‘‰ See: [Runtime > Contexts > Input Contexts](./runtime/contexts#input-contexts).

The shared helper functions and information provided to [Inputs](#input).

These include [Options](#options) as defined by the parent [Base](#base) as well as any [Args](#args) defined by the Input.

## Input Definition

An object describing how to create an [Input](#input).

## Options

The shared set of values defined by a [Base](#base) and used

These are completely separate from any individual [Args](#args).

## Preset

> ðŸ‘‰ See: [Concepts > Presets](./engine/concepts/presets).

A group of [Blocks](#block) associated with the same parent [Base](#base).

## System

> ðŸ‘‰ See: [Runtime > Contexts > System Contexts](./runtime/contexts#system-contexts).

APIs to interact with the file system, network, and shell.

## Template

> ðŸ‘‰ See: [Concepts > Templates](./engine/concepts/templates).

A group of [Presets](#preset) that can be chosen between by a user to generate a repository.
