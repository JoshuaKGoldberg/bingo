description: "Configuring create from a config file."
title: Configuration
---

Running the [Transition mode](/cli#transition-mode) in an existing repository will re-run `create` on that repository.

You can store persistent customizations to the repository's template in a configuration file named `create.config.js`.
It should `export default` a call to a `createConfig()` function that takes in a template and which preset to use.

For example, keeping a repository up-to-date with [`create-example`](https://github.com/JoshuaKGoldberg/create-example):

```ts title="create.config.js"
import { createConfig } from "create";
import { template } from "create-example";

export default createConfig(template;
```

Running `npx create` in a repository with that `create.config.js` would be the equivalent of running `npx create example`.

## `createConfig`

The exported `createConfig` function takes in up to two arguments:

1. A template imported from a package.
   This is always required.
2. An object containing any customizations to be applied to the preset.
   This is only required if the template includes required options.

For example, keeping a repository up-to-date with [`create-typescript-app`](https://github.com/JoshuaKGoldberg/create-typescript-app), which requires a `preset` option to be specified:

```ts title="create.config.js"
import { createConfig } from "create";
import { template } from "create-typescript-app";

export default createConfig(template, { preset: "everything" });
```

Running `npx create` in a repository with that `create.config.js` would be the equivalent of running `npx create typescript-app@beta --preset everything`.
