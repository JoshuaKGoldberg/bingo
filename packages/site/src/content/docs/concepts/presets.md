:::danger
The `create` engine is very early stage.
Don't rely on it yet.

A _Preset_ defines a group of [Blocks](./blocks) that can be put together to form a repository base.
Each Preset includes of a `blocks` array consisting of Blocks generated by the same parent [Schema](./schemas).

For example, this Preset combines all the blocks from [Blocks](./blocks):

```ts
import { blockAllContributors } from "./blockAllContributors";
import { blockNvmrc } from "./blockNvmrc";
import { blockPrettier } from "./blockPrettier";
import { blockREADME } from "./blockREADME";
import { schema } from "./schemas";

export const presetExampleBlocks = schema.createPreset({
	blocks: [
		blockAllContributors(),
		blockREADME(),
		blockPrettier(),
		blockNvmrc(),
	],
});
```
